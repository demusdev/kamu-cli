# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for considering to contribute! This project is a massive undertaking, so every little bit helps.

We welcome contributors of any skill level and background. You [don't have to be a software engineer](https://dev.to/navendu/how-to-make-non-code-contributions-to-open-source-projects-35nj) to make large impact in an open-source project! Besides code you can cotribute in many different ways: improving documentation, improving our CI pipelines, graphic design, adding more interesting data science examples, mentoring others, working with the community...

Before you start working on anything:
1. Consider joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/aSpVjWwu) to discuss your ideas
2. Make sure your work has an associated **GitHub issue**, it's assigned to you, and the scope of work was agreed upon with project maintainers (we value your time and really don't like rejecting PRs!)
3. Read the [Developer Guide](developer_guide.md) on setting up your environment
4. Understand the [Licensing Terms](license_faq.md)

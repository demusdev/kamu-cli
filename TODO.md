# Known issues
- V `NullPointerException` when creating temporary view in sql shell
- V `NoSuchElementException` on every SQL syntax error instead of root cause
- `Kryo serialization failed: Buffer overflow` when manipulating large GIS data
- `Transaction isolation level` warning on sql shell startup
- `sparkmagic` garbles some dataset types and often requires casting to string to preserve data
- `No data or no sasl data in the stream` error in Livy logs due to helth check
